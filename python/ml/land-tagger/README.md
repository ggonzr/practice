# Oracolo - A land tagger application

For this practice, let's code an application to identify and tag elements
included in images (like buildings, crops, cars, houses, etc) using a pool
of AI algorithms. This application should allow users to:

1. Upload their own images or load them from an external location,
2. Display the image on a simple web page.
3. Perform predictions based on the input images and display the identified elements.
4. Load custom AI models to use on predictions.

Also, the application should offer the users a small pool of AI models to quickly test
and display what elements could be found in the input images.

The idea of developing this application is to practice (to refresh and sharpen) skills related to:

1. ML workflows: Development and deployment
2. UI/Web development
3. Software architecture
4. Solution architecture
5. DevOps

#### Note: This idea will be described in more detail in future iterations, please see the future issues for more details.

## Tools to build it

In the future, maybe more will be listed currently let's aim to use

1. Python
2. Tensorflow
3. Rasterio
4. Xarray
5. FastAPI
6. Pydantic
7. Vue.js
8. AWS S3 (Or another object storage)
9. GitHub Actions: Code quality, issues, building, and releasing.
10. Containers: Docker or Podman
11. MLFlow
